# Agile Methodology Reflection

## Prompt
As a group, answer the questions below. For each of these questions, consider specific examples to support your narrative.

* Reflect on your team's communication processes. How did Agile practices, such as **daily stand-up** meetings, facilitate communication and collaboration among team members?
* How did maintaining a **scrum board** play a role in the organization and delegation of tasks in your project?
* Reflect on your team's prioritization of tasks. How did your team create a **timeline for reaching MVP** and how did this prioritization assist in accomplishing your goals?
* What would you have done differently as a group to improve your communication, prioritization, or delegation of tasks?

**Write your reflection using markdown**.

## Reflection Response

1. Daily stand-ups were great in keeping in touch and being accountable with the team. It contextualizes the work for the day, and allowed us both to voice our blockers, if any, so that we could support each other in addressing them. This also means that whatever we initially had in mind to do for the day may change (and it often did) to reflect task priorities.

2. We utilized the scrum board as some sort of meeting notes---anything that we discuss from features to fixes are all logged in it so that we could always refer back to it at any time. In the same way, we are also able to keep track of each other's progress. When we were working asynchronously, the scrum board provided structure and ease with commmunicating tasks and priorities.

3. In terms of following a timeline for reaching MVP, we had to communicate frequently and effectively in order to have a clear vision of what we wanted our product to be. Task prioritization comes naturally when the vision that we have dictates the features we have to implement.

4. While we definitely used the scrum board, we both agree that we did not utilize it fully. Some of the small tasks we did fell through those cracks and were not properly reflected. In general, as the work unfolded before us, we had to wing some stuff and we could have followed Agile methodologies more.
